# Changelog

## v2.4.2 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Fix: RTL toggle crash
- Removed reference to non-existent `_input` attribute (Jules' unified terminal removed it)
- `_toggle_rtl_window` and `_toggle_rtl_line` now only reference `_output`

### Fix: Exit not closing tab
- ConPTY `kill()` now closes the read pipe handle to unblock `_read_loop`'s `ReadFile` call
- This ensures the `exited` signal is emitted when the shell exits

---

## v2.4.1 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Fix: RTL alignment in app
- Fixed `_toggle_rtl_window` to use `document().setDefaultTextDirection()` for proper visual text movement
- Added `setLayoutDirection()` on both output and input widgets
- Set block layout direction and alignment together

### Fix: Exit/close crash diagnosis
- Added `faulthandler` to dump traceback on segfault/SIGFPE
- Added signal handlers for SIGTERM/SIGINT
- ConPTY `kill()` no longer closes pipe handles (let OS clean up)
- `show_exit_message` checks if widget is still in tree before accessing
- All crash paths now log to errors.txt

---

## v2.4.0 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Save / Export Output
- **Save as HTML** (Ctrl+Shift+H) — Preserves theme colors via inline CSS, timestamped filenames
- **Save as Text** (Ctrl+Shift+S) — Plain text export, timestamped filenames
- Added English/Arabic translations for new menu items

### RTL Alignment Fix
- Fixed `_toggle_rtl_window` to set block alignment on all blocks (was using `setAlignment` which doesn't persist)

### Shutdown Safety
- Added `_closing` flag to prevent race conditions during shutdown
- ConPTY `kill()` safe to call multiple times (`_killed` flag)
- All engine cleanup wrapped in try/except

### CI/CD
- Added Windows ARM64 and Linux ARM64 builds (6 platforms total)

---

## v2.3.0 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### CI/CD: Full cross-platform builds
- **Windows ARM64** — Added `windows-11-arm` runner for ARM64 builds
- **Linux ARM64** — Added `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner for ARM64 builds
- **macOS Intel x64** — Using `macos-15-intel` runner (replaces deprecated `macos-13`)
- **macOS ARM64** — `macos-14` runner (unchanged)
- Total: 6 platform builds (Windows x64/ARM64, Linux x64/ARM64, macOS x64/ARM64)

### README
- Updated description to reflect cross-platform nature and unified terminal architecture

---

## v2.2.0 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Unified Terminal Widget (major)
- **Single TerminalScreen widget** replaces dual-pane layout — behaves like a real terminal
- **Arabic shaping + bidi** — Dynamic Arabic character reshaping and bidirectional text
- **Cross-platform PTY** — Windows (ConPTY), Linux/macOS (pty module)
- **Dynamic i18n** — English/Arabic language switching
- **CWD path resolution** — Smart working directory detection via `--path` argument
- **BACKSPACE fix** — `deleteChar()` → `deletePreviousChar()` (correct backward delete)

### CI/CD
- Multi-platform builds: Windows x64, Linux x64, macOS x64, macOS ARM64
- Removed deprecated `macos-13` runner, using `macos-15-intel` for Intel builds

---

## v2.1.6 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Fix: Arrow keys echoing VT sequences, Tab focus jump
- **Arrow keys** — No longer forwarded as VT escape sequences to the shell. Cmd.exe handles its own line editing natively. QTextEdit handles arrow keys for cursor movement in the input area.
- **Tab** — Now consumed by the event filter so focus stays in the input area. Tab character is forwarded to the shell for completion.
- **Backspace, Delete, Escape, Ctrl combos** — Still forwarded to the shell for proper terminal behavior.
- Cleaned up unused `_forward_key` method.
- Updated test: `test_history_forwarded_to_shell` → `test_history_not_forwarded`.

---

## v2.1.5 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Fix: Echo feedback loop creating junk files
- **Root cause** — ConPTY used a single pipe for both input and output. The host read its own input back from the pipe, which was fed into the shell as commands. Shell output fragments became filenames.
- **Fix** — Use TWO separate pipes: one for input (host → shell), one for output (shell → host). This isolates the data flow and eliminates the echo loop.
- Verified working in Python, Nuitka, and PyInstaller builds — no junk files created.

---

## v2.1.4 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Fix: Input not reaching ConPTY shell
- **Root cause** — `TerminalEngine.write()` put data into `input_queue`, but ConPTY has no writer thread consuming that queue. Data was silently dropped.
- **Fix** — When using ConPTY, `write()` now calls `self._conpty.write()` directly instead of using the queue.

---

## v2.1.3 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Fix: Missing PROCESS_INFORMATION struct
- **Root cause** — `ctypes.wintypes` does not have `PROCESS_INFORMATION`. The ConPTY engine used `wt.PROCESS_INFORMATION()` which threw `AttributeError`.
- **Fix** — Defined `PROCESS_INFORMATION` as a ctypes Structure with `hProcess`, `hThread`, `dwProcessId`, `dwThreadId` fields.
- Verified working in Python interpreter, Nuitka, and PyInstaller builds.

---

## v2.1.2 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Fix: CreatePseudoConsole E_INVALIDARG
- **Root cause** — `CreatePseudoConsole` was called with `COORD(0, 0)` as the console size. A zero-size console is invalid and returns `E_INVALIDARG` (0x80070057).
- **Fix** — Pass the actual requested dimensions `(w, h)` to `CreatePseudoConsole` instead of `(0, 0)`. Removed redundant `ResizePseudoConsole` call.
- This fix applies to all run modes: Python interpreter, PyInstaller, and Nuitka.

---

## v2.1.1 — Session 9 (2026-07-22)

### Fix: ConPTY shell not launching
- **Root cause** — `CreateProcessW` requires a writable buffer for `lpCommandLine`, but a Python string was being passed directly. ctypes conversion was insufficient on Nuitka onefile builds.
- **Fix** — Use `ctypes.create_unicode_buffer(cmd)` to create a proper writable buffer.
- **Added error logging** — ConPTY now logs each API call result to errors.txt for debugging.
- **CI fixes** — Drop Python 3.10, set fail-fast:false, add conftest.py for Qt cleanup, tag-only triggers.

---

## v2.1.0 — Session 8 (2026-07-22)

### Critical Fix: Nuitka 5-second crash
- **Root cause** — ConPTY used `STARTUPINFOW` (basic struct) instead of `STARTUPINFOEXW`. Python's ctypes allows setting `lpAttributeList` as a Python attribute, but it was never written to the binary memory `CreateProcessW` reads. The pseudo console attribute was silently ignored, leaving the child process without a console.
- **Fix** — Defined proper `STARTUPINFOEXW` ctypes Structure with `lpAttributeList` in the binary layout. `cb` now reflects the correct extended struct size.
- **Removed `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`** — ConPTY owns its own console; this flag was conflicting.
- **Fixed write path** — Changed from `WriteConsoleInputCharacterW` (console input buffer) to `WriteFile` (pipe) for correct ConPTY input.
- **Improved read loop** — Breaks cleanly on pipe close instead of spinning.
- **Proper cleanup** — Pipe handles closed in `kill()` to prevent handle leaks.

### Cleanup
- Removed dead winpty fallback from `terminal_core.py` (not in requirements)
- Added comprehensive error logging throughout ConPTY lifecycle
- All 141 tests passing

### Documentation
- Full README rewrite — accurate architecture, build instructions, test commands
- BUILD.md updated with troubleshooting section
- CONTRIBUTING.md updated with pytest commands and project structure
- requirements.txt updated with minimum version pins

## v2.0.0 — Session 7 (2026-07-21)

### ConPTY Backend (major)
- **ConPTY replaces winpty** — uses Windows' native Pseudo Console API via ctypes
- **Automatic fallback** — tries ConPTY first, falls back to winpty if unavailable
- **No more winpty dependency** — removed from requirements.txt
- **Fixed cmd.exe crash** — winpty pipe connectivity issue caused 5-second exit; ConPTY resolves this
- **Admin mode** — elevated processes launch via ShellExecuteW

### Source Optimization
